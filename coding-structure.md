# Coding Processes

## general overview: 
- server side will only response back with json responses through rest api for crud operations
- server will send back responses for any successful or failed requests to help user or client 
- server will validate and sanitize any data that might be coming from user to be stored in server
- when data is not met given constraints then a response back with errors list will be sent out to browsers to display them co stand corrected
- user authentication process will be in place to identify and give access to users with json web token
- client side will be responsible for ui and user interactions
- ui should reflect some what acceptable that is
- might consider using matrial ui  for overall ui look
- will use fontawesome for icons and svg resources
- will use tinymce for user ‚Äúcomment and post‚Äù
- for client side considering ‚Äúreusable‚Äù html elements in all coding scenarios instead of writing same html elements individually for them (this is going to be something new, psyched about it üôÇ)

# coding structure

## client side:
- framework: react
- api call will be made for data manipulation from server ideally hosted in cloud for posteruty
- folder structure:
  - components
    - forms-controls
      - legend-element
      - fieldset-element
      - input-type-text-element
      - input-type-number-element
      - input-type-email-element
      - input-type-password-element
      - input-type-button-element
      - input-type-date-element
      - input-type-checkbox-element
      - input-type-radio-element
      - select-type-dropdown-element

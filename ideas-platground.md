# Ideas to play around

## User Over Boarding Flow:
- Ask user to fill in extra informations which will then go into their profile or extended profile (consider separating it from USer model to its own)
- Ask User to Choose some of its favorite topic which user will be interested to see more informations about on their Timeline or Feeds

## Timeline Data
- Use Twitter or Facebook Api for data for those chosen topics (upon click it will take them to news source on their site)
- if not or additionally add some other free api "news based" to show news specific articles (upon click it will take them to news source on their site)

## User profile
- will have list of those chosen topics in there
- can also add or remove from existing topics
- perhaps have a constrained to keep at least few of them, maybe 4 or more
- allow some sort of "random" picture selection for user to have in their profile

## media stoprage
- maybe consider using firebase, for keeping images or media files as a buffer
- or we can simply just have url based media files only

## media apis
- using free api for gifs, pics
- for videos maybe we can look into integrating youtube

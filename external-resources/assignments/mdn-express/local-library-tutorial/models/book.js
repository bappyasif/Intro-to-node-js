// Most of this is similar to the author model â€” we've declared a schema with a number of string fields and a virtual for getting the URL of specific book records, and we've exported the model
let mongoose = require("mongoose");

let Schema = mongoose.Schema

let BookSchema = new Schema(
    {
        title: { type: String, required: true },
        author: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Author', required: true },
        summary: { type: String, required: true },
        isbn: { type: String, required: true },

    }
)

// Virtual for book's URL
BookSchema.virtual("url")
    .get(function () {
        return '/catalog/book/' + this._id;
    });

// main difference here is that we've created two references to other models:
    // author is a reference to a single Author model object, and is required
    // genre is a reference to an array of Genre model objects. We haven't declared this object yet!

//Export model
module.exports = mongoose.model("Book", BookSchema)

        Node.js Introduction

        What is Node.js?
        >> Node.js is an open source server environment
        >> Node.js is free
        >> Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
        >> Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

        Why Node.js?
        >> Node.js uses asynchronous programming!
        >> A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client

        Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request: 
        >> Sends the task to the computer's file system
        >> Waits while the file system opens and reads the file
        >> Returns the content to the client
        >> Ready to handle the next request

        Here is how Node.js handles a file request: 
        >> Sends the task to the computer's file system
        >> Ready to handle the next request
        >> When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client
        
        >> Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request
        >> Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient

        What Can Node.js Do?
        >> Node.js can generate dynamic page content
        >> Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
        >> Node.js can collect form data
        >> Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

        What is a Node.js File?
        >> Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
        >> A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
        >> Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
        >> Node.js files have extension ".js"
     -->

     <!-- 
        Node.js Get Started
        
        Command Line Interface: 
        >> Node.js files must be initiated in the "Command Line Interface" program of your computer
        >> Navigate to the folder that contains the file "myfirst.js"

        Initiate the Node.js File: 
        >> file you have just created must be initiated by Node.js before any action can take place
        >> Start your command line interface, write `node myfirst.js` and hit enter
        >> Now, your computer works as a server!
        >> If anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080 or any specified port number, they will get a "Hello World!" message in return!
      -->

      <!-- 
        Node.js Modules

        What is a Module in Node.js?
        >> Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries
        >> A set of functions you want to include in your application
        
        >> Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation

        Include Modules:
        >> To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module: var http = require('http');
        >> Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server: 
        http.createServer(function (req, res) {
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            res.end('Hello World!');
        }).listen(8080);
        
        Create Your Own Modules: 
        >> You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications
        >> following example creates a module that returns a date and time object:
        exports.myDateTime = function () {
            return Date();
        };
        >> Use the exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside the module file
        >> Save the code above in a file called "myfirstmodule.js"

        Include Your Own Module: 
        >> Now you can include and use the module in any of your Node.js files
        >> Use the module "myfirstmodule" in a Node.js file (my-first.js):
       -->

    <!-- 
        Node.js HTTP Module

        Node.js HTTP Module: 
        >> Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
        >> To include the HTTP module, use the require() method: var http = require('http');

        Node.js as a Web Server: 
        >> HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client
        >> Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:
        `var http = require('http');

        //create a server object:
        http.createServer(function (req, res) {
            res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
            res.end(); //end the response
        }).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
        `
        >> function passed into the http.createServer() method, will be executed when someone tries to access the computer on port 8080
        >> save and initiate file, to see that in action

        Add an HTTP Header:
        >> If the response from the HTTP server is supposed to be displayed as HTML, you should include an HTTP header with the correct content type:
        `var http = require('http');
        http.createServer(function (req, res) {
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            res.write('Hello World!');
            res.end();
        }).listen(8080);
        `
        >> first argument of the res.writeHead() method is the status code, 200 means that all is OK, the second argument is an object containing the response headers

        Read the Query String: 
        >> function passed into the http.createServer() has a req argument that represents the request from the client, as an object (http.IncomingMessage object)
        >> This object has a property called "url" which holds the part of the url that comes after the domain name: `req.url`

        Split the Query String: 
        >> There are built-in modules to easily split the query string into readable parts, such as the URL module
        `var http = require('http');
        var url = require('url');

        http.createServer(function (req, res) {
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            var q = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
            var txt = q.year + " " + q.month;
            res.end(txt);
        }).listen(8080);
        `
        >> Save the code above in a file and initiate the file
        >> try address `http://localhost:8080/?year=2017&month=July` which will result in `2017 July`

     <!-- 
        Node.js File System Module

        Node.js as a File Server: 
        >> Node.js file system module allows you to work with the file system on your computer
        >> To include the File System module, use the require() method: `var fs = require('fs');`
        >> Common use for the File System module: 
            >> Read files
            >> Create files
            >> Update files
            >> Delete files
            >> Rename files

        Read Files: 
        >> fs.readFile() method is used to read files on your computer
        >> Assume we have the following HTML file (located in the same folder as Node.js)
        `<html>
        <body>
            <h1>My Header</h1>
            <p>My paragraph.</p>
        </body>
        </html>
        `
        >> Create a Node.js file that reads the HTML file, and return the content:
        `fs.readFile('demofile1.html', function(err, data) {....}`
        >> Save the code above in a file and initiate the file

        Create Files: 
        >> File System module has methods for creating new files: 
            >> fs.appendFile()
            >> fs.open()
            >> fs.writeFile()
        >> fs.appendFile() method appends specified content to a file. If the file does not exist, the file will be created:
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log('Saved!');
        });
        `
        >> fs.open() method takes a "flag" as the second argument, if the flag is "w" for "writing", the specified file is opened for writing. If the file does not exist, an empty file is created: 
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.open('mynewfile2.txt', 'w', function (err, file) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log('Saved!');
        });
        `
        >> fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file, containing the specified content, will be created:
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log('Saved!');
        });
        `

        Update Files: 
        >> File System module has methods for updating files: 
            >> fs.appendFile()
            >> fs.writeFile()
        >> fs.appendFile() method appends the specified content at the end of the specified file: 
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', ' This is my text.', function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log('Updated!');
        });
        `
        >> fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content:
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'This is my text', function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log('Replaced!');
        });
        `

        Delete Files: 
        >> To delete a file with the File System module,  use the fs.unlink() method
        >> fs.unlink() method deletes the specified file: 
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.unlink('mynewfile2.txt', function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log('File deleted!');
        });
        `

        Rename Files: 
        >> To rename a file with the File System module,  use the fs.rename() method
        >> fs.rename() method renames the specified file: 
        `var fs = require('fs');

        fs.rename('mynewfile1.txt', 'myrenamedfile.txt', function (err) {
            if (err) throw err;

        Node.js URL Module

        Built-in URL Module:
        >> URL module splits up a web address into readable parts
        >> To include the URL module, use the require() method: `var url = require('url');`
        >> Parse an address with the url.parse() method, and it will return a URL object with each part of the address as properties: `url.parse(adr = 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2017&month=february', true);`

        Node.js File Server: 
        >> Now we know how to parse the query string, and in the previous chapter we learned how to make Node.js behave as a file server. Let us combine the two, and serve the file requested by the client
        >> Create two html files and save them in the same folder as your node.js files.
        >> Create a Node.js file that opens the requested file and returns the content to the client. If anything goes wrong, throw a 404 error: see another-scripts.js
        >> and initiate that node.js file
        >> If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you should see two different results when opening these two addresses:

        Node.js NPM

        What is NPM?
        >> NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like
        >> www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use
        >> NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js
        
        What is a Package?
        >> A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module
        >> Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project

        Download a Package
        >> Downloading a package is very easy
        >> Open the command line interface and tell NPM to download the package you want
        >> for example, I want to download a package called "upper-case": `npm install upper-case`
        >> Now you have downloaded and installed your first package!
        >> NPM creates a folder named "node_modules", where the package will be placed. All packages you install in the future will be placed in this folder
        
        Using a Package
        >> Once the package is installed, it is ready to use
        >> Include the "upper-case" package the same way you include any other module: `var uc = require('upper-case');`
        >> for example, Create a Node.js file that will convert the output "Hello World!" into upper-case letters: see another-scripts.js
        >> save and initiate that node.js file

            Node.js Events

            >> Node.js is perfect for event-driven applications

            Events in Node.js: 
            >> Every action on a computer is an event. Like when a connection is made or a file is opened
            >> Objects in Node.js can fire events, like the readStream object fires events when opening and closing a file:

            Events Module: 
            >> Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events
            >> To include the built-in Events module use the require() method. In addition, all event properties and methods are an instance of an EventEmitter object. 
            >> To be able to access these properties and methods, create an EventEmitter object: 
            `var events = require('events');
             var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
            `

            EventEmitter Object: 
            >> You can assign event handlers to your own events with the EventEmitter object
            >> In the example below we have created a function that will be executed when a "scream" event is fired: see another.scripts.js
            >> To fire an event, use the emit() method

            Node.js Upload Files

            Formidable Module: 
            >> There is a very good module for working with file uploads, called "Formidable"
            >> Formidable module can be downloaded and installed using NPM: `npm install formidable`
            >> After you have downloaded the Formidable module, you can include the module in any application: `var formidable = require('formidable');`

            Upload Files: 
            >> Now you are ready to make a web page in Node.js that lets the user upload files to your computer: 
                >> Step 1: Create an Upload Form
                >> Step 2: Parse the Uploaded File
                >> Step 3: Save the File
            
            Step 1: Create an Upload Form: 
            >> Create a Node.js file that writes an HTML form, with an upload field: see another.scripts.js
            >> This code will produce an HTML form: see another.scripts.js

            Step 2: Parse the Uploaded File: 
            >> Include the Formidable module to be able to parse the uploaded file once it reaches the server
            >> When the file is uploaded and parsed, it gets placed on a temporary folder on your computer: see another.scripts.js

            Step 3: Save the File: 
            >> When a file is successfully uploaded to the server, it is placed on a temporary folder
            >> path to this directory can be found in the "files" object, passed as the third argument in the parse() method's callback function
            >> To move the file to the folder of your choice, use the File System module, and rename the file: see another.scripts.js
            >> Include the fs module, and move the file to the current folder: see another.scripts.js
